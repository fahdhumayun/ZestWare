README 4 - Data Collection

The program takes advantage of a database, where all 
information needed is stored. The information can be read, inserted,
edited, or even deleted. Specifically with the manager permissions,
as of now, they have access to inserting and reading data. Regardless,
the database is imperative and the program will utilize even more 
options with database manipulation as necessary.

Any more details for manipulating the data needed for testing is covered
in README1.
